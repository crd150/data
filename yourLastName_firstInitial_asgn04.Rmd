1. As a comprehensive source for neighborhood data, PolicyMap allows you to examine interesting associations across different dimensions of neighborhood health and well-being outside of those provided in the U.S. Census.  Let's examine the potential predictors of resident health in the City of Sacramento. Bring into R the dataset sac_health_policymap.csv, which contains census-tract level data on Sacramento downloaded from PolicyMap.  I've also uploaded the file on Canvas (Files - Week 4 - Assignment). Consider the dataset to be cleaned and ready for analysis.  A record layout of the data can be found here.

a. Create an appropriate plot that shows the shape of the distribution for the variable *health*, which measures the percent of residents reporting very good to excellent health.  Describe the shape of the distribution. 

```{r}
#Add comment explaining code
```

b. Examine the association between *health* and the variable *phys*. Based on this examination, briefly describe the relationship between the variable *health* and *phys*. 

```{r}
#Add comment explaining code
```

c. Create the appropriate plots showing the association between *health* and the following variables: *foodaccess*, *unemp*, and *medinc*.  

```{r}
#Add comment explaining code
```

d. Based on these plots, briefly describe the relationship between *health* and the three variables. Describe any nonlinearities in the relationships. (2 points)


2. The following questions investigate housing structure in Yolo County. Bring into R the dataset ca_border_tracts.csv, which contains 2012-2016 American Community Survey (ACS) data for census tracts in California and states sharing a boundary with California (Arizona, Nevada, and Oregon). I've also uploaded the file on Canvas (Files - Week 4 - Assignment). Consider the dataset to be cleaned and ready for analysis.  A record layout of the data can be found here. 

```{r}

a. Calculate 90/10 percentile ratios for median household income for each region (Bay Area, Southern California, Other California, Arizona, Nevada, and Oregon).  Present these values in a presentation-ready table using flextable().  Which region exhibits the highest neighborhood income inequality? Lowest? 

```{r}

```

b. What is the mean, median, interquartile range, and standard deviation of the percentage of houses built after 2000 in Yolo County? Show these values in a presentation-ready table using flextable().

```{r}
#Add comment explaining code
```

c. What is the correlation between median household income and percentage of houses built after 2000 in Yolo County? 

```{r}
#Add comment explaining code
```

d. Show a plot investigating any potential outliers in the percentage of houses built after 2000 in Yolo County. 

```{r}
#Add comment explaining code
```

e. Did you find any outliers? If so, how many? What is the mean, median and standard deviation of the percentage of houses built after 2000 in Yolo County *without* these outliers? What about the correlation between median household income and percentage of houses built after 2000? Briefly comment on what you learned in question 2e.  (Hint: How are outliers numerically defined in the plot in 2d?)
