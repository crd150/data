```

When going through the lab guides, rather than working directly from the R console, I recommended typing in lab code into an R Markdown and working from there. This will give you more practice and experience working in the R Markdown environment, which you will need to do for all of your assignments. Plus you can add your own comments to the code to ensure that youâ€™re understanding what is being done.  Use this R Markdown template to type in code from the lab guide. 

Type your code in the gray chunks below. R will not run any code after the # sign.  Text after # are meant to be comments you use to explain what the code is doing. For example  

```{r}
#this code adds 1 and 1

1+1
```

Insert any explanatory text of the results outside of the gray chunks.  For example, the above analysis yields the answer 2.

```{r}
#Add comment explaining code

```

Insert any explanatory text here.
