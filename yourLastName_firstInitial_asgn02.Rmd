1. Download the file *q2data.csv* from Canvas (Files -> Week 2 -> Assignment).  Make sure you download it into an appropriate folder on your hard drive. A codebook is also provided.

a. Read the file into R. 

```{r}
#Add comment explaining code
```

b. How many rows are included in the file? What does each row represent? Remember that whenever you can, you need to use code to answer the questions. 

```{r}
#Add comment explaining code
```

c. How many columns are included in the file? What does each column represent?

```{r}
#Add comment explaining code
```

d. Conduct the following data wrangling tasks.  Use the pipe operator to do all of these tasks in one continuous line of code.  Note that you have to decide the appropriate order of the tasks.

* Keep the variables NAME, proportion Asian and Hispanic, and Hispanic and Asian household income.
* Create variables containing the proportion Asian and Hispanic.
* Save the changes into a tibble named q2clean


```{r}
#Add comment explaining code
```

e. Using the tibble q2clean you created in question 1d, determine how many observations have a percent Hispanic greater than 50% and have Hispanic households earning more than $75,000?

```{r}
#Add comment explaining code
```

f. Using the tibble q2clean you created in question 1d, determine how many observations have a percent Asian greater than 50% and have Asian households earning more than $75,000?

```{r}
#Add comment explaining code
```

2. The data set *babynames* contains the number of children of each sex given each name for each year from 1880 to 2017 as collected by the Social Security Administration. All names with more than 5 uses are given. Let's strengthen your data wrangling skills by exploring this unique data set.  Install the package **babynames**.  Run the code `library(babynames)`, `data(babynames)` and `head(babynames)`. You should see the tibble *babynames* pop up in your global environment window. Type in `? babynames` to get a description of this dataset.

a. What was the most popular female baby name in 2017? What about male? 

```{r}
#Add comment explaining code
```

b. Does your name appear in the dataset? If yes, what year was it the most popular? 


```{r}
#Add comment explaining code
```

c. Is the name "Madison" a more popular Male or Female name in 2017? What about in 1984? 

```{r}
