1. Housing eviction has received significant public attention especially in the City of Oakland.  Let's examine the geographic clustering of housing eviction rates in the City of Oakland.

a. Use the Census API to bring in median household income (ID: B19013_001) from the 2015-19 American Community Survey for census tracts in California. 

```{r}
#Insert your code here
```

b. For the object you created in (a), keep census tracts that are located in the City of Oakland. 

```{r}
#Insert your code here
```

c. Download the file oakevict.csv from Canvas (Files - Week 6 - Assignment).  The file contains housing eviction rates for census tracts in Oakland. Merge this file into the object you created in (b). 

```{r}
#Insert your code here
```

d. Calculate the correlation between median household income and eviction rates.

```{r}
#Insert your code here
```

e. Create a map of housing eviction rates using quantile breaks.

```{r}
#Insert your code here
```

f. Construct a Moran scatterplot of housing eviction rates. Use queen contiguity and row-standardized weights.

```{r}
#Insert your code here
```

g. Calculate the Moran's I for housing eviction rates.

```{r}
#Insert your code here
```

h. Explain in words the conceptual difference between the correlation you calculated in 1d and the correlation you calculated in 1g.


i. Are housing eviction rates geographically clustered based on your analysis in (e)-(g)? Explain why or why not.

```{r}
#Insert your code here
```


2. This article claims that Houston is the most racially integrated city in the United States. We'll examine this claim by calculating the spatial clustering of race/ethnic groups using the Moran's I for Houston metropolitan area data. Bring in the shapefile houstondems.zip into R.  This file contains data for census tracts in the Houston metropolitan areas.  The file is located on Canvas (Files - Week 6 - Assignment).  Save the file in an appropriate folder and unzip it to extract the shapefiles. The record layout for the file can be found here.  Consider the file to be clean and ready for analysis.

a. Read the file houstondems.shp into R. Create maps of percent non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Asian, and Hispanic in the Houston metropolitan area using quantile breaks. 

```{r}
#Insert your code here
```

b. Calculate Moran's I for percent non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Asian, and Hispanic in Houston. Use queen contiguity and row-standardized weights. 

```{r}
#Insert your code here
```

c. Summarize in words which race/ethnic groups are geographically clustered in Houston based on your answers in (b).
