1. We are in the midst of a global health crisis marked by profound human suffering. Analyzing the demographic, health and job characteristics of communities reveals that some places are disproportionately affected by this suffering. Communities with no or unstable internet access are at a disadvantage given that employment, medical care (telemedicine), education and other important services are primarily conducted online at home. Let's visually examine the association between internet access and race/ethnicity in  Sacramento county census tracts.

a. Using the Census API, bring in 2015-2019 total, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian, and Hispanic populations for census tracts in Sacramento county.  Check Lab 3 for the appropriate variable IDs. Make sure to bring in spatial data by using `geometry = TRUE`. Calculate the percent Asian, white, black and Hispanic variables.

b. Bring into R the 2015-2019 percent of households without a broadband, cable, Fiber Optic, or DSL internet connection for Sacramento county census tracts from PolicyMap (from the PolicyMap site, click on Health, Computer and Internet Access under the COVID-19 banner, Without High Speed Internet Access, and No Cable, Fiber Optic or DSL). Make sure to clean the data.

```{r}

```

c. Merge the percent of households without a broadband, cable, Fiber Optic, or DSL internet connection to the **sf** census tracts object you created in (a).

d. Create maps of percent non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Asian, and Hispanic using quantile breaks.
